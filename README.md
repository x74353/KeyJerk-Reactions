# KeyJerk Reactions
KeyJerk Reactions speeds up choosing a Reaction and makes it so you don't have to perform any gestures in front of the camera. By assigning a system-wide hot key to each macOS Reaction, you can trigger any Reaction immediately, right there in the moment. You can also trigger a Reaction by calling up a HUD using a system-wide hot key where you can quickly choose your desired Reaction.

## How does it work?
KeyJerk Reactions uses macOS Accessibility APIs to control your Mac. When you trigger a Reaction with a system-wide hot key or other method, KeyJerk Reactions will quickly click all of the buttons and menus needed to apply the Reaction in the current app that is accessing your Mac's camera.

# More Information

## Why Use KeyJerk Reactions?
Available in macOS Sonoma and later, Reactions are video effects such as floating hearts or fireworks that can be applied to the camera feed of most, if not all, apps. This includes FaceTime, Zoom, Slack, and many other apps. 

To trigger a Reaction, you typically need to perform a gesture in front of your Mac's camera, such as making a peace sign ‚úåüèº or a thumbs-up üëçüèº. Most of the time this works well, though you look kind of silly doing it. When it doesn't work, people might wonder what the heck you're doing flashing peace signs at everyone. Otherwise, to manually trigger a Reaction, you have to click a series of buttons and menu which is a slow and tedious process. By the time you've manually chosen your Reaction, it's too late - the effect is lost. KeyJerk Reactions solves this problem by making triggering a Reaction as quick and simple as pressing a system-wide hot key.

KeyJerk Reactions can also integrate with other workflows and automations since it supports AppleScript. With a simple AppleScript or osascript command, you can trigger a Reaction from another app, workflow, or hardware device such as a Stream Deck.

```

## Why is it named KeyJerk Reactions?
It's a play on words with the phrase "knee-jerk reaction." A knee-jerk reaction is a quick, unthinking, reaction you have to something. "Knee" was changed to "Key" because you can use the keyboard to initiate a macOS Reaction using the script. How clever! üòâ

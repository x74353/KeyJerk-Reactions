# Camera
KeyJerk Reactions looks for a camera connected to your Mac that has the word "camera" (case-insensitive) in its name. If you have an external 3rd party camera, you may need to supply KeyJerk Reactions with your camera's name if it doesn't include the word "camera." Follow these instructions to set up your external camera for use with KeyJerk Reactions.

### Steps
<b>Launch any app that accesses your Mac's camera, like Photo Booth or FaceTime.</b> When you see the Audio & Video controls item in the menu bar, click it and check the name of your camera.<BR>

# App Priorities
KeyJerk Reactions will try to apply macOS Reactions in the active/frontmost app by default. If you're in a Zoom meeting and sharing your screen, the active app on your Mac may not be the one that is accessing your camera (i.e., Zoom). To fix this issue, set up App Priorities in KeyJerk Reactions' Settings. When KeyJerk Reactions determines the active app is not accessing your camera, it will use the App Priorities list to determine which app it should try to apply a macOS Reaction in first, second, third, and so on.<BR><BR>App Priorities are also used when multiple apps are accessing your Mac's camera or microphone. Without App Priorities, KeyJerk Reactions won't know which app to try to apply a macOS Reaction in when multiple apps are present in the Audio & Video Controls item in the menu bar.
